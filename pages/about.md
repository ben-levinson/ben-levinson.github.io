 I am a Senior in the BS/MS program at Northwestern University, majoring in Computer Engineering in the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. My interests are primarily in Computer Architecture, Parallel Computing, Embedded Systems, and Machine Learning. In addition to my coursework, I am doing research with the Parallel Architectures Group at Northwestern led by Prof. Nikos Hardavellas, where I’ve been working on collecting detailed information from microarchitectural counters to help construct models of modern multi-core processors.

This year I am also the Electronics Lead for Northwestern’s Formula SAE club. Over the past 2 years, I have worked on projects ranging from assembling the electronic components of the steering wheel, to collecting telemetry data, to generating various control signals for gear shifting, and designing our new power distribution module. Since September 2017, I have also served as a Peer Mentor (Undergraduate TA) for [EECS 213: Intro to Computer Systems](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/courses/descriptions/213-21.html).
