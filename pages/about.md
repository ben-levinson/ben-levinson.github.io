Over the past few years I've done a bunch of things ranging from hardware and software for various embedded systems, machine learning, parallel programming, compilers, performance analysis, and computer architeture. Mostly these are the more open-ended projects from school, but some personal side projects make their way on here. 

I completed my M.S. in Computer Engineering in 2019 at Northwestern University doing research on performance modeling of virtual to physical address translation with Prof. Nikos Hardavellas. I also served as a Peer Mentor (TA) for Intro to Computer Systems from Sept. 2017 - June 2019.

Currently, I am working as a Pre-Si Architectural Validation Engineer at Intel where I try to find bugs in everything from RTL, microcode, testbenches, software models, and specifications.

 <!-- I am a Senior in the BS/MS program at Northwestern University, majoring in Computer Engineering in the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. My interests are primarily in Computer Architecture, Parallel Computing, Embedded Systems, and Machine Learning. In addition to my coursework, I am doing research with the Parallel Architectures Group at Northwestern led by Prof. Nikos Hardavellas, where I’ve been working on collecting detailed information from microarchitectural counters to help construct models of modern multi-core processors.

This year I am also the Electronics Lead for Northwestern’s Formula SAE club. Over the past 2 years, I have worked on projects ranging from assembling the electronic components of the steering wheel, to collecting telemetry data, to generating various control signals for gear shifting, and designing our new power distribution module. Since September 2017, I have also served as a Peer Mentor (Undergraduate TA) for [EECS 213: Intro to Computer Systems](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/courses/descriptions/213-21.html).
