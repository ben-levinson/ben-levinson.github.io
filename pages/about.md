I am a junior at Northwestern University majoring in Computer Engineering in the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. My interests are primarily in Computer Architecture, Parallel Computing, Machine Learning, and Embedded Systems. I am a member of Northwestern Formula Racingâ€™s Electronics sub-team, where I have worked on projects ranging from displaying telemetry data to control signals and power distribution. From Fall 2017 through Winter 2018, I am also serving as a Peer Mentor (Undergraduate TA) for [EECS 213: Intro to Computer Systems](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/courses/descriptions/213.html).
