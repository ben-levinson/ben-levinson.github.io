Over the past few years I've done a bunch of things ranging from hardware and software for various embedded systems, machine learning, parallel programming, compilers, performance analysis, and computer architecture. Mostly these are the more open-ended projects from school, but some personal side projects make their way on here.

I completed my M.S. in Computer Engineering in 2019 at Northwestern University doing research on performance modeling of virtual to physical address translation with Prof. Nikos Hardavellas. I also served as a Peer Mentor (TA) for Intro to Computer Systems from Sept. 2017 - June 2019.

Currently, I am working as a Pre-Si Architectural Validation Engineer at Intel where I try to find bugs in everything from RTL, microcode, testbenches, software models, and specifications.
