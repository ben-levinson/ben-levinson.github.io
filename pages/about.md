 I’m currently a Junior in the BS/MS program at Northwestern University, majoring in Computer Engineering in the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. My interests are primarily in Computer Architecture, Parallel Computing, Embedded Systems, and Machine Learning. In addition to my coursework, I am doing research with the Parallel Architectures Group at Northwestern led by Prof. Hardavellas, where I’ve been working on collecting detailed information from microarchitectural counters to help construct models of modern multi-core processors.

I am also the incoming Electronics Lead for Northwestern’s Formula SAE club. Over the past 2 years, I have worked on projects ranging from collecting telemetry data to generating various control signals for our engine to designing our new power supply. This year, I have also served as a Peer Mentor (Undergraduate TA) for [EECS 213: Intro to Computer Systems](http://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/eecs/courses/descriptions/213.html).
